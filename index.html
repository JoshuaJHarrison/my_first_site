    <h1>A Budding Romance</h1>
    <img src="images/cozy reading.png" alt="A cozy reading space">
    <h3><p>When i was in elementary school i hated to read. My mom always insisted that i should read and would occasionally force to
      but it never stuck. I dont know if this was true for you guys as it was for me but we had this scholastic fair every once
      in a while. For this one fair my mom told me to look at the list and she would buy the book i wanted, i cant remember why
      but i ended up picking a book called
       <a href="http://www.scholastic.com/planetpilkey/">The Adventures of Captain Underpants</a>. Even though it was a comic and not
      an actual book i fell in love with it. After that my bought me every book that came out for it and i ventured out to other
      books that caught my interest. Since then, reading has become my whole life. I quickly accelerated past my grades reading level
      the more i read and the harder the books were. One book i remember having for the longest, and probably still have, is the
      Warriors series. Unfortunately by the time the series had finished i was already in highschool and felt i had outgrown that level
      and didnt complete the series but i got through a big chunk of it. I still held on to them becuase of the fond memories, same as
      the other books in my collection, but those where from a time when i was just starting out getting a feel for reading and figuring
      out the things i loved in books. When i read i feel like i living another life through the eyes of someone else, like a passanger
      along for the ride. I see what they see, i hear what they hear, and i feel what they feel. When a story is told so beautifuly its
      like you've known no other world besides that one. I dont where nor the type of person i would be without books but i can guarantee you i would not have been a
      better person. </p></h3>
